The development team treats this session only as a user-level cache for the important stuff. The session can be lost at any time and everything must be recoverable from external backend services or a database. Thus no load balancing based on cookies or any session locking is needed when serving parallel requests from one user.

I18n and l10n have more detailed documentation available: Dates and Time Zones and Translations.</p> <p>The UI must not be aware of what service is called under the hood and maintain a consistent API schema and error handling.

Using only <code>200</code> with the status code buried in the JSON body is strictly prohibited. Some HTTP status codes (e.g. <code>400</code>, <code>422</code>) may return additional error code in the body that helps the UI to better describe the cause of the error and display a proper message.</p> <p>Every <code>5XX</code> error is automatically reported to Sentry and an alert is risen to the ONL team, so the endpoint should never raise those errors intentionally. <code>4XX</code> status codes must be used to indicate errors that are expected and user can recover from them.</p> <p>To improve performance, endpoints should cache the output if it's possible using <code>Cache-Control</code> headers.

All new features in EBO must be developed in the modern SPA, if there is a need for new features in the legacy part, it should get migrated first to the modern stack.</p> <p>The modern stack uses a components architecture with strict separation of concerns and presentation logic. Every component must be testable and tested in unit tests and/or in integration tests. Each component style must follow BEM methodology, while the application styles follow the ITCSS architecture on top of that. We built our own components library that adheres to these rules, you can find the modern version and the legacy version in GitHub.</p> <p>The SPA uses a state management pattern to store the state of components on the client side (just like Django's session does the same on the server side). The app, in order to be SPA, also includes routing (just like Django's URLs).</p> <p>CSS evolved over time from using LESS to SASS to PostCSS with CSS variables, you can find all of them still being used in the project. The modern stack must only use PostCSS with CSS variables in order to scale our branding solution. In addition, we use Tailwind CSS for better DXP and very needed consistency of our CSS styles.</p> <p>Everything is bundled together using webpack 5 (wrapped by Vue CLI 5) using modern principles like three shaking and dynamic imports to minimise the size of the final bundle. The legacy Vue code uses webpack 4 (wrapped by Vue CLI 4); and the legacy core, written before the webpack era, uses Gulp 4.</p> <p>The weakest point of the legacy code is lack of testing. The spaghetti code is not testable at all and the development requires lots of manual tests to be performed before going live. Some scenarios are covered by the E2E tests but mainly critical happy paths in the legacy.</p> <p>We set a high priority for testing everything properly in the modern stack. The components architecture allows us to test every component individually in unit tests using Jest and then test all components together in integration tests (Cypress) covering all edge cases. We test the code to have a full confidence when shipping the code and making changes in the code.</p> <p>For more detailed documentation about our modern UI stack check out the Frontend guide.</p>"},{"location":"EBO/Architecture/#backends-internal-systems","title":"Backends (internal systems)","text":"<p>EBO doesn't own any domain data, but rather retrieves data from backends behind the EBO (e.g. Ebury's <code>natonly</code>, <code>backoffice</code> clusters or from Salesforce servers).
